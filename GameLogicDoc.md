## Potential Issues

Orders are still valid even after a player leaves the game. I am not sure
whether or not this introduces an exploit, or how it affects zero-sumness.
Even without this aspect; the zero sumness of the game is questionable because
players are free to join and leave whenever, thus value can leave the table.
Such is the life of an online game.
